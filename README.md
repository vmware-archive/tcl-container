tcl-container
=============

Create a tinycorelinux container to build apps for it - useful for boot2docker

To create a tinycorelinux docker image, call the script mktcl.sh:
./mktcl.sh

Then build a development container out of using the Dockerfile:

sudo docker build .

This can then be used to build open-vm-tools and libdnet, using the file build.sh:

sudo docker tag 53a89975885d tinycorelinux:ovt-devel

The build script will put the tarballs into the directory /tarballs, so you
need to create a local dir and map it to the container with the -v option:

sudo docker run  -v ${PWD}/tarballs:/tarballs -t -i ovt-devel /root/build.sh
